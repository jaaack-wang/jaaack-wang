									<p>
										I am a recent MA graduate in Applied Linguistics from the University of Saskatchewan. 
										My main research interests are in natural language processing, computational social science, and language technology. 
										I employ both computational and linguistic approches to studying the properties of languages (i.e., English and Mandarin) 
										and their linguistic and social meanings inferred from actual language use in large-scale linguistic corpora (already built or compiled through web scraping). 
									</p>

									<p>
										Inspired by Andrew Ng, I believe in the prospect of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo" target="_blank"> Data-centric AI (versus Model-centric AI)</a>. 
										This is because with the maturing of deep learning frameworks and cloud computing, trying out different machine/deep learning models becomes generally much cheaper than 
										having a well-designed dataset, and the qualifty of the dataset becomes a main reason that causes the performances of SOTA models plateau out. 
										That implies, <b>domain knowledge (plus some data science knowledge) in data construction and annotation</b> will play an increasingly impotant role in
										real-world deep learning application. Natural language processing or computational linguistics is certainly not an exception.

									<h3>Bio</h3>
									<p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuqing" target="_blank">Fuqing</a>, a county-level city in Fujian province, the southeastern coast of China. 
										From 2015 to 2019, I studied at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan_University" target="_blank">Hunan University</a> for my Bachelor's degree. Majoring in Chinese 
										Language and Literature, I found my passion for linguistics in the second semester of my first year in college and managed to undertake a two-year project on  
										the construction of Chinese grammar, funded by the national Student Innovation Program. I was also fortunate to be selected for a summer internship at the 
										University of Alberta for an experimental psycholinguistic research project.
									</p>
									<p>
										Besides literature- and linguistics- related essays/papers, I spent considerable time writing essays in philosophy, history, and law during my bachelor's years. 
										Prior to coming to Hunan University, I devoted most weekends of my last year in high school working on a 40-page long essay addressing Chinese notions of sex over time.
										 
									</p>
									<p>
										From 2019 to 2021, I studied at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Saskatchewan" target="_blank">University of Saskatchewan</a> majoring in Applied Linguistics. 
										I taught myself programming and started building computational tools, relying on linguistic knowledge (rule-based) and statistical learning algorithms, to carry out 
										my research, which was about analysis of language use based in large-scale English corpora. 
									</p>
									<p>
										With more experiences in programming and mathematics, the recent months have seen me learning and participating in extensive machine/deep learning 
										courses/training. I have shared many of my learning experiences as well as tools I built on my <a href="https://github.com/jaaack-wang?tab=repositories" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

									<h4>
										Moments
									</h4>
									<p>
										I am a hodophile or travel lover. As an old Chinese sayings goes, 读万卷书不如行千里路 
										(reading tens of thousands of books is less worthwhile than traveling thousands of miles). But more importantly, 
										life is all about experiences. It is always those special moments in life that define who we are.
