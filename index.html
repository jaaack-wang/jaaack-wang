									<p>
										I am a recent MA graduate in Applied Linguistics from the <a href="https://www.usask.ca" target="_blank">University of Saskatchewan</a>. 
										My main research interests are in natural language processing, corpus linguistics, and computational social science. 
										I employ both computational and linguistic approches to studying the properties of languages (i.e., English and Mandarin) 
										and their linguistic and social meanings inferred from actual language use in large-scale linguistic corpora. 
									</p>

									<p>
										Inspired by Andrew Ng, I believe in the prospect of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo" target="_blank"> data-centric AI (versus model-centric AI)</a>. 
										This is because with the maturing of deep learning frameworks and cloud computing, trying out different machine/deep learning models becomes generally much cheaper than 
										having a well-designed dataset, and the qualifty of the dataset becomes a main reason that causes the performances of SOTA models to plateau out. 
										That implies, <b>domain knowledge (plus some data science knowledge) in data construction, annotation and augmentation</b> will play an increasingly impotant role in
										real-world deep learning applications. Natural language processing or computational linguistics is certainly not an exception.

							<section id="Bio">
								<div class="container">
									<h3>Bio</h3>
									<p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuqing" target="_blank">Fuqing</a>, a county-level city in Fujian province, the southeastern coast of China. 
										From 2015 to 2019, I studied at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan_University" target="_blank">Hunan University</a> for my Bachelor's degree. Majoring in Chinese 
										Language and Literature, I found my passion for linguistics in the first year of university and managed to undertake a two-year funded project on  
										the construction of Chinese grammar. I was also fortunate to be selected for a summer internship at the 
										University of Alberta for an experimental psycholinguistic research project.
									</p>
									<p>
										Besides literature- and linguistics- related essays/papers, I spent considerable time doing research in law, history, social science, and a bit of western philosophy during my bachelor's years. 
										Prior to coming to Hunan University, I devoted most weekends of my last year in high school working on a 40-page long essay addressing diachronic notions of sex of Chinese, which I see as 
										the very beginning of my academic career. Some of my writings are shared on <a href="#Misc">Misc</a>.
										 
									</p>
									<p>
										From 2019 to 2021, I studied at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Saskatchewan" target="_blank">University of Saskatchewan</a> majoring in Applied Linguistics. 
										I taught myself programming and computational linguistics from scratch during this period of time when I focused on quantitative and data-driven analysis of language use in transcribed linguistic corpora. 
										I have become an active user of GitHub since last year and so far I have open-sourced several text processing and annotating tools, a variety of linguistic datasets, as well as 
										extensive notes and tutorials on deep learning in connection with a variety of NLP tasks. You are more than welcome to visit my <a href="https://github.com/jaaack-wang" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
