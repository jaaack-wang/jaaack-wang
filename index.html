										I am a recent MA graduate in Applied Linguistics from the <a href="https://www.usask.ca" target="_blank">University of Saskatchewan</a>. 
										My main research interests are in natural language processing, corpus linguistics, and computational social science. 
										I employ both computational and linguistic approaches to studying the properties of languages and their linguistic and 
										social meanings inferred from actual language use in large-scale linguistic corpora. I am also highly interested how neural networks encode linguistic knowledge
										and "learn" human languages. 
									</p>

									<p>
										Inspired by Andrew Ng, I believe in the prospect of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo" target="_blank"> data-centric AI (versus model-centric AI)</a>. 
										With my research, I aim to leverage both linguistic domain knowledge and learning algorithms to help train more robust NLP (Natural Language Processing) models with data that 
										is either much smaller in size or can be obtained with much less manual efforts. Only in this way can we advance computational linguistics to understudied text and language domains
										and bring more practical values to the real world.

									<h3>Bio</h3>
									<p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuqing" target="_blank">Fuqing</a>, a small southeastern city of China. 
										From 2015 to 2019, I studied at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan_University" target="_blank">Hunan University</a> for my Bachelor's degree. Majoring in Chinese 
										Language and Literature, I found my passion for linguistics in the first year of university and managed to undertake a two-year funded project on Chinese grammar and a psycholinguistic 
										internship in Canada. Besides literature- and linguistics- related research, I also spent time doing research in law, history, social science, and a bit of philosophy.  
									</p>
									<p>
																				 
									</p>
									<p>
										From 2019 to 2021, I studied at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Saskatchewan" target="_blank">University of Saskatchewan</a>, majoring in Applied Linguistics. 
										I taught myself programming and computational linguistics and focused on quantitative and data-driven analysis of language use in transcribed linguistic corpora. From purely rule-based 
										programming, exemplified by extensive regular expressions for syntactic parsing, text extraction, and corpus annotation, I steadily became fluent in building NLP models using statistical machine 
										learning and deep learning.

										(reading tens of thousands of books is less worthwhile than traveling thousands of miles). But more importantly, 
										life is all about experiences. It is always those special moments in life that define who we are.
