# Chong’er Meets the Eunuch Pi①



## Characters

**Marquis of Jin**: That is, Chong’er. Because of the Liji turmoil he lived in exile for nineteen years; later, relying on the power of Duke Mu of Qin, he killed Marquis Huai of Jin, returned to Jin, and established a regime. What this play depicts is the time when Chong’er had just seized power.

**Eunuch Pi**: A eunuch, who once, under orders from Duke Xian of Jin and Duke Hui of Jin, attempted twice to assassinate Chong’er, both times unsuccessfully.

**Lü Sheng, Xi Rui**: Trusted old ministers of Duke Hui of Jin, the most vehement opponents of Chong’er.

**Zi Fan**: Chong’er’s maternal uncle.

**Guards**: Several men, all bestowed by Duke Mu of Qin, charged exclusively with Chong’er’s personal safety. Any one guard is referred to simply as “Guard,” without finer distinction.



## **Curtain Rises**

【Background: It is midnight; the scene is dark. Though there is no smoke or fog, it is hazy. At this time, the heavens are murky and turbid; neither stars nor moon can be seen. Only the cool wind, tireless, now rising, now falling, passes through mountain caves and threads through doors and windows, forming the sound of nature. On the ground, at the center of the stage stands a dilapidated old palace hall, which in this night grows all the more deathly. The windows and doors of the palace are tightly shut; only the yellow light within cannot be fully contained, emitting a faint candle-glow. Before the palace doors, several guards stand holding weapons, their faces showing no weariness.】

【Outside the hall. A shadow suddenly appears. Before long, it silently slips to the front of the hall doors.】

Guard: (on alert, raising weapon, in a low voice) Who goes there? If you do not cherish your own life and enter the forbidden area, then head and body will lie apart—this will not be our fault.

Eunuch Pi: (unruffled, voice soft and yin②) I am Eunuch Pi, an old minister of the false court③. The false court has already fallen; the Marquis of Jin has returned by Heaven’s mandate, and the revival of Jin is foreseeable—therefore I come to submit. Now there are rebellious ministers and traitorous sons who secretly plot treason, to be carried out within days. If we do not stop small evils before they grow, Jin may be imperiled! That is why I have come. I request an audience with the Marquis of Jin.

Guard: (suspicious) First make the treason plot clear; only then will we report it.

Eunuch Pi: (disdainful, fierce in voice and expression, letting out a loud, long sigh) Jin is in peril! Jin is in peril!

(sings):

Jin is in peril, Jin is in peril,  
Rebellious ministers, traitorous sons, plot treason.  
Jin’s revival is far from being reached.  
Jin is in peril, Jin is in peril,  
I cannot see the Marquis of Jin’s face—  
Heaven’s mandate may in the end be wiped out here.  
Jin is in peril, Jin is in peril,  
You do not take the state’s fate to heart,  
Only making later men sit and sigh.  
Jin’s revival is far from being reached,  
Heaven’s mandate may in the end be wiped out here,  
Only making later men sit and sigh.

Marquis of Jin: (voice from inside the hall) Guards! (sternly) Who outside makes a racket, drumming up gloom with song?

【Inside the hall. An oil lamp flickers, revealing a vast emptiness. A man paces with hands behind his back, head lowered, lost in thought, alone in the hall. Looking at him, his appearance is unkempt, yet his body is strong and his bearing great, quite imposing. This man is the Marquis of Jin. Suddenly, the hall doors open; a guard enters and comes before the Marquis of Jin.】

Guard: (cupping hands) The one making a disturbance outside claims to be Eunuch Pi.

Marquis of Jin: (stops at once, startled and enraged) Eunuch Pi!

Guard: (with a look of contempt) The castrated one declares he wishes to submit, and wants to report to Your Lordship some rebel’s treason plot from the false court—mysterious and secretive, relying on self-importance. (earnest) In this minister’s view, Eunuch Pi is but a petty wretch. The reason he exposes treason and uproots the disloyal may be to claim merit and win favor, to protect himself and rise in rank; or he may wish to confuse and mislead, harboring other designs. Eunuch Pi’s heart is unfathomable! This minister asks that he be removed early. It is for Your Lordship to decide.

Marquis of Jin: (as if no one is there, speaking to himself) Eunuch Pi! Eunuch Pi! You sought to rid me of my life twice—have you forgotten? Have you forgotten? (the guard, hearing this, is astonished) The scar is still there; humiliation and hatred have not vanished—yet now you dare to come see me; is your heart unfathomable! Is your heart unfathomable! (coming to himself) Guards! Impose palace punishment④ on him—cut off his life!

Guard: (smiling without showing it) Yes.

Marquis of Jin: (as if realizing something) Cut off his life! Cut off his life!

(sings):

Nineteen years I wandered abroad,  
Kin had little grief, foes took joy.  
What love would a eunuch bear for me?  
Twice by orders he came to take my life.  
Now the court has changed, the dynasty replaced—  
My kin are gone, I alone feel glad.  
The eunuch does not remember the scar remains;  
With heart unfathomable, why come suffer so?  

[The guard exits.]

Marquis of Jin: (again paces with hands behind back, head lowered, musing; aside) No. If Eunuch Pi knows the times and understands my heart, then what courage, what boldness would he have to carry his head, bearing orders, to seek an audience with me? Even if he were stupid, he would not go so far—let alone one shrewd and cunning who has served three lords.

【Outside the hall. Eunuch Pi is surrounded by the guards. Suddenly, the hall doors open; a guard comes out.】

Guard: (feigning sudden anger) Bold eunuch! You harbor a plot against the Marquis of Jin, wishing to remove him and then rejoice, to entrap us in unrighteousness—do you think we do not know? Bold eunuch! Your heart is unfathomable! The Marquis of Jin has given an order: cut off your life! Cut off the eunuch’s life!

All Guards: Cut off the eunuch’s life! Cut off the eunuch’s life!

[All guards raise their weapons.]

Eunuch Pi: (expression unchanged, upright and forceful) If I intended to harm the Marquis of Jin, I would hang myself in a ditch—there would be no need to trouble you with weapons. Why would I use my life to disgrace myself? If I do not intend to harm the Marquis of Jin and yet am struck down and lose my life, then your unrighteousness is self-invited, not mine; the Marquis of Jin’s harm would be self-brought, also not mine. (a slight pause) I have heard it: in the former lord’s good governance, he kept the high seat empty to await the common people; he did not discard a man for his lowliness, nor discard words for a man’s faults—how could he listen only to sages and worthies? Therefore he attained good governance, and under Heaven none did not submit. (voice and expression growing even stronger) The Marquis of Jin was exiled for nineteen years, suffered sorrow and met peril, trod thorns and waded briars, was tossed and hurried, traveled through the various states, reading words and watching faces as daily fare; it should follow that he is well-versed in the subtleties of human and heavenly ways, the mysteries of principles and things—he does not pursue what is past, does not remonstrate against what is done; he plans deeply and looks far, asks earnestly and thinks closely, gathers all counsel and all strength, to bring real benefit and open grand designs. Now he is reckless and careless to this extent, not pardoning me because of old grudges and new suspicions—my death, then, truly has its reason! (laughs loudly) Jin is in peril! Jin is in peril!

Guard: (unmoved) Useless talk helps not; the eunuch dies! Bind him! Carry him elsewhere, cut off his life, so that the eunuch’s filthy blood and rotting corpse do not harm the royal fortune.

All Guards: (very loud) Cut off the eunuch’s life! Cut off the eunuch’s life!

[Suddenly, the hall doors open, yet not a person is seen.]

Marquis of Jin: (voice from within, slightly ethereal, yet firm and clear) Lead Eunuch Pi inside; I wish to see him.

All Guards: Yes.

【Inside the hall. Eunuch Pi strides forward, imposing. The guards follow, surrounding him from behind. The oil lamp is as before, flickering without cease, yet its light grows ever more dim and yellow, dark and dull. The Marquis of Jin faces away from the crowd, standing motionless.】

Guard: (cautiously) Eunuch Pi is here.

Marquis of Jin: (waving a hand) All guards, withdraw for now. (some guards would show unwillingness to withdraw) All guards, withdraw for now.

All Guards: Yes.

[All guards withdraw.]

Marquis of Jin: (slowly turns, gentle voice and pleasant face) You come today—will it also bring benefit to our state?

Eunuch Pi: (expressionless, glancing about) No. No benefit. Why must one speak of benefit?

Marquis of Jin: (suddenly changing countenance, feigning reproach) What vile words are these? Have you forgotten our old enmity? In the affair at Pu City, my lord ordered one night, and you arrived at once. Later I followed the Lord of Di to hunt by the banks of the Wei; you came for Duke Hui seeking to kill me—he ordered you three nights, and you arrived on the middle night. (loudly) Though you had your lord’s orders, how swift you were! The scar still remains—go on your way! Go on your way!

[Outside the hall the guards stir.]

Eunuch Pi: (disdainful) This minister thought that when you entered, you would know it; (righteous and stern) if you still do not, you will soon meet calamity. A lord’s order has no second—such is the ancient rule. To remove a lord’s evil, one looks only to strength. The people of Pu, the people of Di—what have I to do with them? Now you are enthroned; do you have no Pu, no Di? Duke Huan of Qi set aside the arrowhead and made Guan Zhong his minister; if you change likewise, what shame is there in obeying orders? (ever more impassioned) Those who go are many—how could it be for a punished man!

Marquis of Jin: (clapping and laughing) That benefits our state! That benefits our state! (lightly placing both hands on Eunuch Pi’s shoulders, meeting his eyes) My earlier words were only to test you; you truly are a worthy man! That I could not employ you earlier is my fault. Just now, when you first arrived and sought to see me, it happened I was thinking to exhaust my mind and drain my thoughts—how to lift decay and renew abuses, and revive our state. (face showing shame) Therefore I acted willfully and in anger; without due thought I let old enmity breed new suspicion, nearly losing an arm and leg. That is my fault. I have heard there are old ministers who wish to rebel against me; I trouble you to state the matter in detail.

Eunuch Pi: (with a slight air of pride) That you weary body and exhaust heart for state and people is this minister’s fortune, the common people’s fortune—how could I blame you? You returned in accord with Heaven’s mandate, rule in response to the people’s heart; you will renew our state—this is inevitable by the trend. (puts his mouth to the Marquis of Jin’s ear, softly, only the Marquis can hear) Thus I have heard: Lü and Xi, fearing coercion, sharpen weapons and feed horses, scatter wealth and gather men, intending on the dark night to burn the ducal palace and murder you. Plan early. If you do not plan early, then when Lü and Xi besiege the city, the matter of reviving the state will be difficult.

Marquis of Jin: (clapping and laughing) That benefits our state! That benefits our state! That I could not employ you earlier is my fault. Without your words, the matter of reviving the state would become a bubble-shadow. Without your words, my life would end, our state’s blessings and fortune would perish! Are you Heaven’s condemnation sent to aid me?

Eunuch Pi: (slightly pleased) Your words exceed the truth—am I truly so? You follow Heaven’s mandate and gain the people’s heart; can Lü and Xi’s rebellion succeed? If my words were lacking, surely another would come to expose the matter; it is not something I alone can keep private. I have said it: to remove a lord’s evil, one looks only to strength; aside from this there is no second heart.

(sings):

You follow Heaven’s mandate, gain the people’s heart;  
Our state, within days, will be revived.  
How could it be that my words turn east and west waters⑥?  
Only a red heart illuminates the annals⑦.  

You follow Heaven’s mandate, gain the people’s heart;  
Our state, within days, will be revived.  
How could it be that my words turn east and west waters?  
Only a red heart illuminates the annals.

[Suddenly, the hall doors open; Zi Fan enters.]

Marquis of Jin: Uncle! (points to Eunuch Pi, earnestly) This is a good minister, of benefit to our state. (puts his mouth to Zi Fan’s ear; Eunuch Pi can hear his voice, but the guards cannot) Through him I learned of Lü and Xi’s plan to, on the dark night, set fire to my palace and murder me. Without this man, my life would end, our state’s blessings and fortune would perish! (in a low voice, only Zi Fan can hear) Yet Eunuch Pi is a petty man who looks only to strength; he has served three lords, and cannot be entrusted with everything to the end. I use him now only to make clear my heart in employing men. He is not my chief minister.

Zi Fan: (facing Eunuch Pi, smiling) You are indeed a good minister, greatly beneficial to our state! I am willing to yield to you and entrust great affairs to you—how about it?

Eunuch Pi: (both startled and delighted) How would this minister dare to invite merit to curry favor, to sit above you? By merit, I truly am not even one-tenth of you—how would I dare speak of merit? Only let us with combined strength assist the lord’s great enterprise.

Zi Fan: Good. You are a loyal and good man, and will surely be heavily employed! (puts his mouth to Eunuch Pi’s ear, softly, only Eunuch Pi can hear) I see weariness on the lord’s face; we should withdraw at once. The lord works late and rises early; mind and strength are doubly strained. Tonight is already deep, and we trouble him with trivial matters—unworthy. (facing the Marquis of Jin) The night is deep; my lord should rest early. We shall not trouble you.

Marquis of Jin: (weariness on his face) What trouble is there? You all are my arms and legs; even keeping the seat empty to await you is not enough—what trouble is there?

Eunuch Pi: (concerned) The lord decides ten thousand affairs daily, works late and rises early; now there is weariness on your face—we should of course not trouble you with trivial matters. To trouble the lord with trivial matters—Heaven detests it! Heaven detests it!

[Eunuch Pi and Zi Fan withdraw.]



## Curtain Falls



## Notes

① This script takes the segment “Eunuch Pi requests an audience” from *Zuo Zhuan: The Exile of Prince Chong’er of Jin* and fictionalizes it, with a few quotations altered by changed characters. The original source text is:

> Lü and Xi, fearing coercion, were going to burn the ducal palace and murder the Marquis of Jin. Eunuch Pi requested an audience. The duke had someone rebuke him, and also dismissed him. He said: “In the affair at Pu City, my lord ordered one night, and you arrived at once. Later I followed the Lord of Di to hunt by the banks of the Wei; you came for Duke Hui seeking to kill me—he ordered you three nights, and you arrived on the middle night. Though you had your lord’s orders, how swift you were! The scar still remains—go on your way!” He replied: “This minister thought that when you entered, you would know it; if you still do not, you will soon meet calamity. A lord’s order has no second—such is the ancient rule. To remove a lord’s evil, one looks only to strength. The people of Pu, the people of Di—what have I to do with them? Now you are enthroned; do you have no Pu, no Di? Duke Huan of Qi set aside the arrowhead and made Guan Zhong his minister; if you change likewise, what shame is there in obeying orders? Those who go are many—how could it be for a punished man!” The duke saw him and told him of the difficulty...... On yichou, the last day of the month, the ducal palace burned.

② Eunuch Pi is, after all, a *siren*—a eunuch. A *siren*, that is, a castrated man; therefore his voice is soft and yin. In this play, all sounds that issue from Eunuch Pi’s mouth are soft and yin. The same below, hence no further notes.

③ As for the term “false court,” it is used for the time being; what follows as “the court has changed, the dynasty replaced” is the same. Guessing at the ancients’ intent, perhaps there truly was a sense of dynastic change—one cannot know. As for Chong’er, “changed court, replaced dynasty” is said to mock his self-conceit.

④ Here Chong’er’s wish to impose palace punishment on Eunuch Pi is likely due to the subconscious. When hatred reaches its extreme, even eating flesh and sleeping on skin is not enough to satisfy—how much more mere castration? Twice Chong’er narrowly entrusted his neck to Eunuch Pi; his contempt for the eunuch is beyond what pen and ink can fully express, lodged in the subconscious. At this time, what his mouth muttered and his mind thought was all Eunuch Pi; with the subconscious at work, it is no wonder he wished to “repeat construction”!

⑤ “Kin” is taken in its ancient sense. Here it refers specifically to the “kin” who did not worry about Chong’er’s exile. And such “kin,” in Chong’er’s view—could they be only nineteen!

⑥ “East and west waters” means to breach the western waters and send them eastward, a metaphor for changing the original pattern of things. This cannot be done without a grand hand.

⑦ Here the famous saying of Wen Tianxiang is borrowed in secret—not to claim exclusive praise for the past, but in jest.
