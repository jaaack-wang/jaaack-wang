In this mid-autumn of the Bingshen year, it so happens to be the 2,567th anniversary of the birth of our Former Teacher Confucius; thus is this piece respectfully offered in praise:



Clouds lie across the Xiang River; the autumn ripples are calm and faint.  
Gathered into the great mountain range, stored within famed mountains.

Heaven, ruler, teacher, kin—still as in the old ways.  
At the Grand Sacrifice to Confucius, the common people look up in reverence.



Thinking of the man he was—he rested in utmost goodness.  
Born when the times were in decline, rites collapsed and music fell into disorder.

He loathed purple usurping vermilion; he was ever without unrighteous war.  
He traveled persuading the feudal states, repeatedly meeting with hardship.

All the world surged on, and the benevolent had no peace.  
Like water rushing downward, he alone turned back the raging tide.

The former worthies stood lofty—sun and moon are hard to reach!



All under Heaven are one body, and all things are companions—his teaching followed thus.  
Three thousand disciples bathed in spring at the Apricot Altar.

Lofty and bright, the Doctrine of the Mean; he exhausted its two ends.  
Subtle words, great meaning—none who see it do not sigh in admiration.

The lingering grace of the former sages shall never be cut off through endless years!



In today’s world, development leaps forward.  
Desires for things run rampant—nowhere can one escape.

Spirit is scarce; worldly affairs are absurd.  
Happily relying on national learning, the humanities return day by day.

Drill into it, work at it, to share in its fruits!



Yuelu Academy, foremost among Chu’s talents.  
Careful in ending, mindful in tracing afar—the cultural lineage is inherited and passed on.

Later generations are to be feared, with sweet-flag at the waist and orchid in the sash.  
Together we chant the classics, delighting in antiquity as though it were sweet.

Revive the declining and raise the worn—may the forebears’ hearts be at ease!



Humbly, may it be accepted!
